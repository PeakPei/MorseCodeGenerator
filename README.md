MorseCodeGenerator
==================

Simple app that converts ascii into morse code, with options to present the code with flashs and vibrations.

What it's really about: an excuse to mess with the private api AudioServicesPlaySystemSoundWithVibration to generate patterned vibrations. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12966467/are-there-apis-for-custom-vibrations-in-ios for details.
